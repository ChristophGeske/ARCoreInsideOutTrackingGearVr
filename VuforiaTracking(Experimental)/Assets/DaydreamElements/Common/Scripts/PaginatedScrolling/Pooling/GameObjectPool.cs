  /// will generate a large amount of memory allocations.

  /// Additionally, when an object is returned to the pool it isn't reparented to the container
  /// object until the end of the frame. This way, if the same object is borrowed again before
  /// the end of the frame (a common occurence), it isn't reparented an extra time.
  /// Reparenting an object can cause a significant amount of memory allocations and CPU load.
