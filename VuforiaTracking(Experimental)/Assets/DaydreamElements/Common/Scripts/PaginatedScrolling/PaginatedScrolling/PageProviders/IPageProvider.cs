namespace DaydreamElements.Common {
  /// This script is an in interface that provides content pages
  /// for a PagedScrollRect (Paginated Scrolling)
  ///
  /// The derived class must inherit from MonoBehaviour and be placed on the
  /// same object as PagedScrollRect
  ///
  /// Two generic implementations are included:
  ///
  /// ChildrenPageProvider - This implementation automatically uses the children of the
  /// PagedScrollRect as the pages. The pages are in order of their SiblingIndex in the scene.
  /// This is the simplest way to do PaginatedScrolling.
  ///
  /// PrefabPageProvider - This implementation takes a serialized list of prefabs that are
  /// dynamically instantiated/destroyed as the user scrolls through the ScrollRect.
  ///
  /// Here are some example use cases for a custom implementation:
  /// 1. Page content is provided asynchronously by a network call.
  /// 2. Page content utilizes pooling/object re-use to optimize memory/allocations.
  /// 3. Page content could be data-driven by ScriptableObjects or some other data file.
  ///
  public interface IPageProvider {
    /// Returns a float that represents the amount of space between pages
    /// in coordinates local to the PagedScrollRect.
    float GetSpacing();

    /// Returns the total number of pages.
    int GetNumberOfPages();

    /// Returns the appropriate page to display at the index passed in.
    /// This could be implemented by allocating the page, or by just showing it.
    RectTransform ProvidePage(int index);

    /// Removes the page passed in, as it has been scrolled out of view.
    /// This could be implemented by destroying the page, or by just hiding it.
    void RemovePage(int index, RectTransform page);
